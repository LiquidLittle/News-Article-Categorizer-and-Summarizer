make its Sandoz unit the worlds biggest generic drug producer\\n\\nNovartis which last month forecast record sales for 2005 said it had bought all of Germanys Hexal It also acquired 677 of Hexals US affiliate Eon Labs and offered to buy the remaining shares for 31 each Novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about 200m a year following the acquisitions Novartis shares rose 1 to 5785 Swiss francs in early trading\\n\\nThe deal will see Novartis Sandoz business overtake Israels Teva Pharmaceuticals as the worlds biggest maker of generics Based on 2004 figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than 5bn the company estimated Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments adding that there may be job cuts\\n\\nThe strong growth outlook for Sandoz which will create jobs is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force the firm said in a statement Generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals Producers such as Sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost\\n\\nThere are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented However not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal This is a very expensive acquisition Birgit Kuhlhoff from Sal Oppenheim investment bank told Reuters I find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure\\n   \n",

showRevised figures indicated growth of just 01  and a similarsized contraction in the previous quarter On an annual basis the data suggests annual growth of just 02 suggesting a much more hesitant

the data I maintain the view that Japans economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb and we will monitor developments carefully said economy minister Heizo Takenaka But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead observers were less sanguine Its painting a picture of a recovery much patchier than previously thought said Paul Sheard economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo Improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand with private consumption up just 02 in

stay in line He has rewarded their faith On Wednesday as Judge Gorsuch made his initial courtesy visits to senators on Capitol Hill Republican lawmakers assumed the tone of a party in power appealing for unity and adherence to Senate custom Judge Gorsuchs first call after the announcement of his nomination was to Mr Garland as a gesture of respect according to Ron Bonjean a spokesman for the nomination effort The nominee was also joined on Wednesday by Kelly Ayotte a   former Republican senator from New Hampshire who is helping to shepherd him through the nominating process months after losing her   bid After greeting Judge Gorsuch during his visit Mr McConnell asked Democrats to heed their own calls to restore the court to its rightful size I would invite Democrats who spent many months insisting we need nine to join us in following through on that advice he said from the Senate floor So far Democrats have appeared unmoved and occasionally seething Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the minority leader said Judge Gorsuch     who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit     must meet the   threshold required to overcome a filibuster in the Senate History     and especially recent history     demand it he suggested This is nothing new It was a bar met by each of President Obamas nominations Mr Schumer said He argued that if Judge Gorsuch could not attract enough support the answer will not be to change the rules of the Senate but to change the nominee to someone who can earn 60 votes  He added that Mr Trumps White House had demonstrated less respect for the rule of law than any in recent memory placing a special burden on this nominee to be an independent jurist  Breaking a filibuster would require eight members of the Democratic caucus to join the 52 members of the Republican majority to advance the nomination or force Republicans to change longstanding rules and push through the nomination on a simple majority vote Transfers of power from one party to the other often compel lawmakers to shift their perspectives leaning on arguments they once rejected But the bipartisan whiplash in the Senate has been especially striking Since Mr Trumps announcement the two parties have rushed headlong into an embrace of the others former talking points Republicans have cast Judge Gorsuch as an unassailable choice as Democrats did with Judge Garland trumpeting his appeals court record and his impressive credentials They reminded some Senate Democrats that they had voted to confirm Judge Gorsuch to a lower court once upon a time as some Republicans had for Judge Garland Senators like Ted Cruz Republican of Texas     who before the election raised the possibility of blocking a nomination indefinitely if Hillary Clinton won the presidency     have insisted on swift action And some Democrats have argued after nearly a year spent lamenting the vacancy on the court since Justice Antonin Scalias death that Judge Gorsuch must not be allowed to assume the seat The Democrats should treat Trumps SCOTUS pick with the exact same courtesy the GOP showed Merrick Garland Dan Pfeiffer a former senior adviser to Mr Obama wrote on Twitter Dont flinch dont back down  Reactions to Judge Gorsuchs nomination among Democrats seemed to sort themselves into three camps There were some cautious statements often from moderate Democrats in states that Mr Trump won urging careful consideration of the pick There were   concerns raised about Judge Gorsuchs trail of conservative opinions and leanings And there were arguments that did not focus much on Judge Gorsuch at all instead framing the choice   \n",

Wednesday to invoke the   nuclear option and abandon the   threshold for confirmation If we end up with that gridlock I would say If you can Mitch go nuclear the president said Democrats are weighing strategies for opposing the nomination of Judge Neil M Gorsuch and debating how aggressively to pursue a battle over a seat that many of them believe was stolen from their party In selecting a respected deeply conservative jurist Mr Trump has dared Democrats to pursue the kind of blanket obstructionism that they long accused Republicans of embracing during the Obama administration That

a spokesman for the nomination effort The nominee was also joined on Wednesday by Kelly Ayotte a   former Republican senator from New Hampshire who is helping to shepherd him through the nominating process months after losing her   bid After greeting Judge Gorsuch during his visit Mr McConnell asked Democrats to heed their own calls to restore the court to its rightful size I would invite Democrats who spent many months insisting we need nine to join us in following through on that advice he said from the Senate floor So far Democrats have appeared unmoved and occasionally seething Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the minority leader said Judge Gorsuch     who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit     must meet the   threshold required to overcome a filibuster in the Senate History     and especially recent history     demand it he suggested This is nothing new It was a bar met by each of President Obamas nominations Mr Schumer said He argued that if Judge Gorsuch could not attract enough support the answer will not be to change the rules of the Senate but to change the nominee to someone who can earn 60 votes  He added that Mr Trumps White House had demonstrated less respect for the rule of law than any in recent memory placing a special burden on this nominee to be an independent jurist  Breaking a filibuster would require eight members of the Democratic caucus to join the 52 members of the Republican majority to advance the nomination or force Republicans to change longstanding rules and push through the nomination on a simple majority vote Transfers of power from one party to the other often compel lawmakers to shift their perspectives leaning on arguments they once rejected But the bipartisan whiplash in the Senate has been especially striking Since Mr Trumps announcement the two parties have rushed headlong into an embrace of the others former talking points Republicans have cast Judge Gorsuch as an unassailable choice as Democrats did with Judge Garland trumpeting his appeals court record and his impressive credentials They reminded some Senate Democrats that they had voted to confirm Judge Gorsuch to a lower court once upon a time as some Republicans had for Judge Garland Senators like Ted Cruz Republican of Texas     who before the election raised the possibility of blocking a nomination indefinitely if Hillary Clinton won the presidency     have insisted on swift action And some Democrats have argued after nearly a year spent lamenting the vacancy on the court since Justice Antonin Scalias death that Judge Gorsuch must not be allowed to assume the seat The Democrats should treat Trumps SCOTUS pick with the exact same courtesy the GOP showed Merrick Garland Dan Pfeiffer a former senior adviser to Mr Obama wrote on Twitter Dont flinch dont back down  Reactions to Judge Gorsuchs nomination among Democrats seemed to sort themselves into three camps There were some cautious statements often from moderate Democrats in states that Mr Trump won urging careful consideration of the pick There were   concerns raised about Judge Gorsuchs trail of conservative opinions and leanings And there were arguments that did not focus much on Judge Gorsuch at all instead framing the choice</td>\n",

make its Sandoz unit the worlds biggest generic drug producer\\n\\nNovartis which last month forecast record sales for 2005 said it had bought all of Germanys Hexal It also acquired 677 of Hexals US affiliate Eon Labs and offered to buy the remaining shares for 31 each Novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about 200m a year following the acquisitions Novartis shares rose 1 to 5785 Swiss francs in early trading\\n\\nThe deal will see Novartis Sandoz business overtake Israels Teva Pharmaceuticals as the worlds biggest maker of generics Based on 2004 figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than 5bn the company estimated Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments adding that there may be job cuts\\n\\nThe strong growth outlook for Sandoz which will create jobs is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force the firm said in a statement Generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals Producers such as Sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost\\n\\nThere are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented However not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal This is a very expensive acquisition Birgit Kuhlhoff from Sal Oppenheim investment bank told Reuters I find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure\\n   \n",

the data I maintain the view that Japans economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb and we will monitor developments carefully said economy minister Heizo Takenaka But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead observers were less sanguine Its painting a picture of a recovery much patchier than previously thought said Paul Sheard economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo Improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand with private consumption up just 02 in

              "4  WASHINGTON     President Trump seeming to relish a fight with Democrats over his nominee to the Supreme Court encouraged the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday to invoke the   nuclear option and abandon the   threshold for confirmation If we end up with that gridlock I would say If you can Mitch go nuclear the president said Democrats are weighing strategies for opposing the nomination of Judge Neil M Gorsuch and debating how aggressively to pursue a battle over a seat that many of them believe was stolen from their party In selecting a respected deeply conservative jurist Mr Trump has dared Democrats to pursue the kind of blanket obstructionism that they long accused Republicans of embracing during the Obama administration That would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was put up to that neglect he said from the Roosevelt Room of the White House For the Democrats who have struggled to match the fury and zeal of the partys base during the wave of   activism since the election a   showdown may prove unavoidable doubling as a referendum on resistance tactics to a White House that liberals fear Democrats intend to repeatedly remind the public about the Republicans treatment of Merrick B Garland President Barack Obamas nominee to fill the vacant seat last year who was blocked from even receiving a hearing Mr McConnell had said a justice should not be seated during an election year even though there is no prohibition on such action Now their gambit successful Republicans will seek to capitalize on the groundwork laid since Mr Trumps election Leading conservative groups have united for a   campaign to help Judge Gorsuch producing television commercials planning gatherings at megachurches and contacting supporters to encourage them to demand a vote from their senators For Republicans who were leery of Mr Trumps campaign last year the prospect of adding a conservative to the court was often a powerful motivator to stay in line He has rewarded their faith On Wednesday as Judge Gorsuch made his initial courtesy visits to senators on Capitol Hill Republican lawmakers assumed the tone of a party in power appealing for unity and adherence to Senate custom Judge Gorsuchs first call after the announcement of his nomination was to Mr Garland as a gesture of respect according to Ron Bonjean a spokesman for the nomination effort The nominee was also joined on Wednesday by Kelly Ayotte a   former Republican senator from New Hampshire who is helping to shepherd him through the nominating process months after losing her   bid After greeting Judge Gorsuch during his visit Mr McConnell asked Democrats to heed their own calls to restore the court to its rightful size I would invite Democrats who spent many months insisting we need nine to join us in following through on that advice he said from the Senate floor So far Democrats have appeared unmoved and occasionally seething Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the minority leader said Judge Gorsuch     who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit     must meet the   threshold required to overcome a filibuster in the Senate History     and especially recent history     demand it he suggested This is nothing new It was a bar met by each of President Obamas nominations Mr Schumer said He argued that if Judge Gorsuch could not attract enough support the answer will not be to change the rules of the Senate but to change the nominee to someone who can earn 60 votes  He added that Mr Trumps White House had demonstrated less respect for the rule of law than any in recent memory placing a special burden on this nominee to be an independent jurist  Breaking a filibuster would require eight members of the Democratic caucus to join the 52 members of the Republican majority to advance the nomination or force Republicans to change longstanding rules and push through the nomination on a simple majority vote Transfers of power from one party to the other often compel lawmakers to shift their perspectives leaning on arguments they once rejected But the bipartisan whiplash in the Senate has been especially striking Since Mr Trumps announcement the two parties have rushed headlong into an embrace of the others former talking points Republicans have cast Judge Gorsuch as an unassailable choice as Democrats did with Judge Garland trumpeting his appeals court record and his impressive credentials They reminded some Senate Democrats that they had voted to confirm Judge Gorsuch to a lower court once upon a time as some Republicans had for Judge Garland Senators like Ted Cruz Republican of Texas     who before the election raised the possibility of blocking a nomination indefinitely if Hillary Clinton won the presidency     have insisted on swift action And some Democrats have argued after nearly a year spent lamenting the vacancy on the court since Justice Antonin Scalias death that Judge Gorsuch must not be allowed to assume the seat The Democrats should treat Trumps SCOTUS pick with the exact same courtesy the GOP showed Merrick Garland Dan Pfeiffer a former senior adviser to Mr Obama wrote on Twitter Dont flinch dont back down  Reactions to Judge Gorsuchs nomination among Democrats seemed to sort themselves into three camps There were some cautious statements often from moderate Democrats in states that Mr Trump won urging careful consideration of the pick There were   concerns raised about Judge Gorsuchs trail of conservative opinions and leanings And there were arguments that did not focus much on Judge Gorsuch at all instead framing the choice   \n",

Wednesday to invoke the   nuclear option and abandon the   threshold for confirmation If we end up with that gridlock I would say If you can Mitch go nuclear the president said Democrats are weighing strategies for opposing the nomination of Judge Neil M Gorsuch and debating how aggressively to pursue a battle over a seat that many of them believe was stolen from their party In selecting a respected deeply conservative jurist Mr Trump has dared Democrats to pursue the kind of blanket obstructionism that they long accused Republicans of embracing during the Obama administration That would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was put up to that neglect he said from the Roosevelt Room of the White House For the Democrats who have struggled to match the fury and zeal of the partys base during the wave of   activism since the election a   showdown may prove unavoidable doubling as a referendum on resistance tactics to a White House that liberals fear Democrats intend to

party in power appealing for unity and adherence to Senate custom Judge Gorsuchs first call after the announcement of his nomination was to Mr Garland as a gesture of respect according to Ron Bonjean a spokesman for the nomination effort The nominee was also joined on Wednesday by Kelly Ayotte a   former Republican senator from New Hampshire who is helping to shepherd him through the nominating process months after losing her   bid After greeting Judge Gorsuch during his visit Mr McConnell asked Democrats to heed their own calls to restore the court to its rightful size I would invite Democrats who spent many months insisting we need nine to join us in following through on that advice he said from the Senate floor So far Democrats have appeared unmoved and occasionally seething Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the minority leader said Judge Gorsuch     who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit     must meet the   threshold required to overcome a filibuster in the Senate History     and especially recent history     demand it he suggested This is nothing new It was a bar met by each of President Obamas nominations Mr Schumer said He argued that if Judge Gorsuch could not attract enough support the answer will not be to change the rules of the Senate but to change the nominee to someone who can earn 60 votes  He added that Mr Trumps White House had demonstrated less respect for the rule of law than any in recent memory placing a special burden on this nominee to be an independent jurist  Breaking a filibuster would require eight members of the Democratic caucus to join the 52 members of the Republican majority to advance the nomination or force Republicans to change longstanding rules and push through the nomination on a simple majority vote Transfers of power from one party to the other often compel lawmakers to shift their perspectives leaning on arguments they once rejected But the bipartisan whiplash in the Senate has been especially striking Since Mr Trumps announcement the two parties have rushed headlong into an embrace of the others former talking points Republicans have cast Judge Gorsuch as an unassailable choice as Democrats did with Judge Garland trumpeting his appeals court record and his impressive credentials They reminded some Senate Democrats that they had voted to confirm Judge Gorsuch to a lower court once upon a time as some Republicans had for Judge Garland Senators like Ted Cruz Republican of Texas     who before the election raised the possibility of blocking a nomination indefinitely if Hillary Clinton won the presidency     have insisted on swift action And some Democrats have argued after nearly a year spent lamenting the vacancy on the court since Justice Antonin Scalias death that Judge Gorsuch must not be allowed to assume the seat The Democrats should treat Trumps SCOTUS pick with the exact same courtesy the GOP showed Merrick Garland Dan Pfeiffer a former senior adviser to Mr Obama wrote on Twitter Dont flinch dont back down  Reactions to Judge Gorsuchs nomination among Democrats seemed to sort themselves into three camps There were some cautious statements often from moderate Democrats in states that Mr Trump won urging careful consideration of the pick There were   concerns raised about Judge Gorsuchs trail of conservative opinions and leanings And there were arguments that did not focus much on Judge Gorsuch at all instead framing the choice</td>\n",
